You can do a git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking branches 
under refs/remotes/<remote>/. This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads,
and is safe to do without changing your working copy. 


A git pull is what you would do to bring a local branch up-to-date with its remote version, while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.

git diff remotes/origin/development..development
git fetch origin
git diff origin/development
git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
